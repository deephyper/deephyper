# Deephyper GNN module

## Edit 1
```deephyper/deephyper/search/nas/model/space/op/gnn.py```
The code for all GNN building blocks.

### Edit 2
```deephyper/deephyper/datasets/gnn_datasets/```
The directory contains all dataset used for the paper. The .py files depends on DeepChem library.

### Edit 3
```deephyper/deephyper/search/nas/model/train_utils.py```
I added some self-defined metrics for experiments.
