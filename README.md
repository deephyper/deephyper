Start using DeepHyper today and take your machine-learning skills to the next level!

## Install Instructions

Installation with `pip`:

```console
pip install deephyper
```

More details about the installation process can be found at [DeepHyper Installations](https://deephyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/index.html).

## Quickstart

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deephyper/tutorials/blob/main/tutorials/colab/DeepHyper_101.ipynb)

The black-box function named `run` is defined by taking an input job named `job` which contains the different variables to optimize `job.parameters`. Then the run-function is bound to an `Evaluator` in charge of distributing the computation of multiple evaluations. Finally, a Bayesian search named `CBO` is created and executed to find the values of config which **MAXIMIZE** the return value of `run(job)`.

```python
def run(job):
    # The suggested parameters are accessible in job.parameters (dict)
    x = job.parameters["x"]
    b = job.parameters["b"]

    if job.parameters["function"] == "linear":
        y = x + b
    elif job.parameters["function"] == "cubic":
        y = x**3 + b

    # Maximization!
    return y


# Necessary IF statement otherwise it will enter in a infinite recursion
# when loading the 'run' function from a child processes
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from deephyper.hpo import CBO, HpProblem
    from deephyper.evaluator import Evaluator

    # define the variable you want to optimize
    problem = HpProblem()
    problem.add_hyperparameter((-10.0, 10.0), "x") # real parameter
    problem.add_hyperparameter((0, 10), "b") # discrete parameter
    problem.add_hyperparameter(["linear", "cubic"], "function") # categorical parameter

    # define the evaluator to distribute the computation
    evaluator = Evaluator.create(
        run,
        method="process",
        method_kwargs={
            "num_workers": 2,
        },
    )

    # define your search and execute it
    search = CBO(problem, evaluator, random_state=42)

    results = search.search(max_evals=100)
    print(results)
```

Which outputs the following results where the best parameters are with `function == "cubic"`, 
`x == 9.99` and `b == 10`.

The code defines a function `run` that takes a RunningJob `job` as input and returns the maximized objective `y`. The `if` block at the end of the code defines a black-box optimization process using the `CBO` (Centralized Bayesian Optimization) algorithm from the `deephyper` library.

The optimization process is defined as follows:

1. A hyperparameter optimization problem is created using the `HpProblem` class from `deephyper`. In this case, the problem has three variables. The `x` hyperparameter is a real variable in a range from -10.0 to 10.0. The `b` hyperparameter is a discrete variable in a range from 0 to 10. The `function` hyperparameter is a categorical variable with two possible values.
2. An evaluator is created using the `Evaluator.create` method. The evaluator will be used to evaluate the function `run` with different configurations of suggested hyperparameters in the optimization problem. The evaluator uses the `process` method to distribute the evaluations across multiple worker processes, in this case, 2 worker processes.
3. A search object is created using the `CBO` class, the problem and evaluator defined earlier. The `CBO` algorithm is a derivative-free optimization method that uses a Bayesian optimization approach to explore the hyperparameter space.
4. The optimization process is executed by calling the `search.search` method, which performs the evaluations of the `run` function with different configurations of the hyperparameters until a maximum number of evaluations (100 in this case) is reached.
5. The results of the optimization process, including the optimal configuration of the hyperparameters and the corresponding objective value, are printed to the console.
