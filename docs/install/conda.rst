Install DeepHyper with conda
****************************

DeepHyper installation requires ``Python>=3.10``.

.. warning:: All packages required for your application need to be installed in the same environment.

DeepHyper is a pure Python package and therefore does not require a conda building recipy to be installed because DeepHyper's code does not need to be compiled. However, many of DeepHyper's dependencies can require compilation (depending on your system) to optimize computation. For this reason, using conda can be a good option to install DeepHyper and its dependencies.

Linux
-----

Install Miniconda form the `official installation guide <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_, and create a new environment for DeepHyper called ``dh``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda create -n dh python=3.10 -y
    $ conda activate dh
    $ conda install gxx_linux-64 gcc_linux-64

Finally install DeepHyper with ``pip`` within this environement:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pip --upgrade
    $ pip install "deephyper[default]"

.. note:: More details about DeepHyper's optional modules can be found in the :ref:`install-pip` section.

MacOS
-----

MacOS users can either have ``x86_64`` or ``arm64`` architecture. To check your architecture, open a terminal and run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    python3 -c "import platform; print(platform.platform());"


In any case on MacOS, you need to install Xcode command line tools first:

.. code-block:: console

    xcode-select --install


x86_64
######

If your architecture is ``x86_64`` install `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_, and create the ``dh`` environment:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda create -n dh python=3.10 -y
    $ conda activate dh

Then install DeepHyper in the previously created ``dh`` environment:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pip --upgrade
    $ pip install "deephyper[default]"

.. note:: More details about DeepHyper's optional modules can be found in the :ref:`install-pip` section.

arm64
#####

If your architecture is  ``arm64`` download `MiniForge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh>`_ then install it:

.. code-block:: console

    chmod +x ~/Downloads/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
    sh ~/Downloads/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh

After installing MiniForge clone the DeepHyper repo and install the package:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/deephyper/deephyper.git
    cd deephyper/
    conda env create -f install/environment.macOS.arm64.yml

.. note:: More details about DeepHyper's optional modules can be found in the :ref:`install-pip` section.
