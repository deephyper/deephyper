Installations
=============

DeepHyper is a Python package containing different modules that can be installed in differents ways. The following sections describe the different ways to install DeepHyper. The DeepHyper package itself is a pure Python package and therefore does not need "compilation". However, some of the (optional) modules of DeepHyper require external libraries to be installed which can require compilation when pre-built binaries are not available (or not optimized) for your target system (e.g., Tensorflow or Numpy).
