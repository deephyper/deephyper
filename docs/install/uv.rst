Install with uv
***************

DeepHyper can also be installed with the `uv tool <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ which is a fast Python package and project manager. The uv commands shown below will create a Python project with a virtual environment that contains the deephyper package. See the uv documentation for more information about working with Python using the uv tool.

.. code-block:: console

   $ uv init myproject
   $ cd myproject
   $ uv add deephyper

Below is a demo of creating a Python project with uv, adding the deephyper package to the project, then running Python in the project's virtual environment to import deephyper and get its version number.
