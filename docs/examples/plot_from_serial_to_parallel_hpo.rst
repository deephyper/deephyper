From Sequential to Massively-Parallel Bayesian Optimization
===========================================================

**Author(s)**: Romain Egele.

This example demonstrates the advantages of parallel evaluations over sequential
evaluations with Bayesian optimization. We start by defining a black-box ``run``-function that 
implements the Ackley function:

.. image:: https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/ackley.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: Ackley Function in 2D

To help illustrate the parallelization gain, we will simulate a computational cost
by using ``time.sleep``. We also use the ``@profile`` decorator to collect starting/ending
times of each call to the ``run``-function. When using this decorator, the ``run``-function will
return a dictionnary including ``"metadata"`` with 2 new keys ``"timestamp_start"`` and
``"timestamp_end"``. The ``run``-function is defined in a separate Python module
for better serialization (through ``pickle``) in case other parallel backends such as ``"process"`` would be used

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/black_box_util.py
   :language: python

After defining the ``run``-function we can continue with the definition of our optimization script:

    from deephyper.evaluator.callback import TqdmCallback
    from deephyper.hpo import HpProblem, CBO

Then, we define the variable(s) we want to optimize. For this problem we
optimize Ackley in a N-dimensional search space. Each dimension in the continuous range
[-32.768, 32.768]. The true minimum is located at ``(0, ..., 0)``.

Then, we define some default search parameters for the Centralized Bayesian Optimization (CBO) algorithm.

        "surrogate_model_kwargs": {
            "n_estimators": 25, # Relatively small number of trees in the surrogate to make it "fast"

Then, we define the time budget for the optimization. We will compare the performance of a sequential
search with a parallel search for the same time budget. The time budget is defined in seconds.

    timeout = 60 # 1 minute

Then, we define the sequential Bayesian optimization search.

    sequential_search = CBO(problem, black_box.run_ackley, **search_kwargs)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-83

The previously simplified definition of the search is equivalent to the following:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 83-93

.. code-block:: Python

    sequential_evaluator = Evaluator.create(
        black_box.run_ackley,
        method="thread",  # For synchronous function defintion relying on the GIL or I/O bound tasks
        method_kwargs={
            "num_workers": 1, 
            "callbacks": [TqdmCallback()]
        },
    )
    sequential_search = CBO(problem, sequential_evaluator, **search_kwargs)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 94-101

Where we use the ``"thread"``-evaluator with a single worker and use the ``TqdmCallback`` to display
a progress bar during the search. 

We can now run the sequential search for 2 minutes. The call to the ``search``-method will return a
DataFrame with the results of the search.

If this step is executed multiple times without creating a new search the results will be accumulated in the same DataFrame.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 101-107

    results = {}
    results["sequential"] = sequential_search.search(timeout=timeout)
    offset = results["sequential"]["m:timestamp_start"].min()
    results["sequential"]["m:timestamp_end"] -= offset
    results["sequential"]["m:timestamp_start"] -= offset

Each row of the DataFrame corresponds to an evaluation of the ``run``-function. The DataFrame contains the following columns:
- ``"p:*"``: The parameters of the search space.
- ``"objective"``: The objective value returned by the evaluation.
- ``"job_id"``: The id of the evaluation in increasing order of job creation.
- ``"job_status"``: The status of the evaluation (e.g., "DONE", "CANCELLED").
- ``"m:timestamp_submit/gather"``: The submition and gathering times of the evaluation by the ``Evaluator`` (includes overheads).
- ``"m:timestamp_start/end"``: The starting and ending time of the evaluation.

We can now plot the results of the sequential search. The first plot shows the evolution of the objective.
The second plot shows the utilization of the worker over time.

It can be surprising to see in the results that the last lines have ``"job_status"`` set to "CANCELLED" but
still have an objective value. This is due to the fact that the cancellation of a job is asynchronous and already scheduled Asyncio tasks are therefore executed. When the timeout is reached the jobs created by the "thread" method jobs cannot be directly killed but rather their ``job.status`` is updated to ``"CANCELLING"`` and the user-code is responsible for checking the status of the job and interrupting the execution. This is why the objective value is still present in the results. This behavior is different from the "process" method where the jobs are killed directly.

We can now plot the results of the parallel search. The first plot shows the evolution of the objective.
The second plot shows the utilization of the worker over time.

We can see that the parallel search is able to evaluate a lot more points in the same time budget. This also
allows the algorithm to explore more of the search space and potentially find better solutions.
The utilization plot shows that the workers are used efficiently in the parallel search (above 80%).

Finally, we compare both search with the execution time is used as the x-axis.
The advantage of parallelism is clearly visible by the difference in the number of evaluations and in objective.
