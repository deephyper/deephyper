Profile the Worker Utilization
==============================

**Author(s)**: Romain Egele.

This example demonstrates the advantages of parallel evaluations over serial
evaluations. We start by defining an artificial black-box ``run``-function by
using the Ackley function:

.. image:: https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/ackley.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: Ackley Function in 2D

We will use the ``time.sleep`` function to simulate a budget of 2 secondes of
execution in average which helps illustrate the advantage of parallel
evaluations. The ``@profile`` decorator is useful to collect starting/ending
time of the ``run``-function execution which help us know exactly when we are
inside the black-box. This decorator is necessary when profiling the worker
utilization. When using this decorator, the ``run``-function will return a
dictionnary with 2 new keys ``"timestamp_start"`` and ``"timestamp_end"``.
The ``run``-function is defined in a separate module because of
the "multiprocessing" backend that we are using in this example.

After defining the black-box we can continue with the definition of our main script:

    import black_box_util as black_box
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    from deephyper.analysis import figure_size
    from deephyper.analysis.hpo import (
        plot_search_trajectory_single_objective_hpo,
        plot_worker_utilization,

    from deephyper.evaluator import Evaluator
    from deephyper.evaluator.callback import TqdmCallback
    from deephyper.hpo import CBO, HpProblem








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-50

Then we define the variable(s) we want to optimize. For this problem we
optimize Ackley in a 2-dimensional search space, the true minimul is
located at ``(0, 0)``.

    for i in range(nb_dim):

    problem
