Software Architecture
*********************

Software Components
===================

The architecture of DeepHyper is based on the following components:

    **Figure 1**: Generic software components of DeepHyper. The blue boxes are components defined by the user. The orange boxes are the components that can be configured by the user but not necessarily. The arrows represent the data flow.

The blue boxes are components defined by the user. The orange boxes are the components that can be configured by the user but not necessarily. The arrows represent the data flow. 

First, the user must provide a **search space** and an **objective function**. The search space is defined through the :mod:`deephyper.problem` module (with :class:`deephyper.problem.HpProblem` for hyperparameter optimization and :class:`deephyper.problem.NaProblem` for neural architecture search). The objective function is simply a Python function that returns the objective to maximize during optimization. This is where the logic to evaluate a suggested configuration is happening. It is commonly named the ``run``-function across the documentation. This ``run``-function must follow some standards which are detailed in the :mod:`deephyper.evaluator` module.

Then, the user can choose how to **distribute the computation** of suggested tasks in parallel. This distributed computation is abstracted through the :class:`deephyper.evaluator.Evaluator` interface which provides the ``evaluator.submit(configurations)`` and ``results = evaluator.gather(...)`` methods. A panel of different backends is provided: serial (similar to sequential execution in local process), threads, process, MPI, and Ray. This interface to evaluate tasks in parallel is possibly synchronous or asynchronous by batch. Also, the :class:`deephyper.evaluator.Evaluator` uses the :class:`deephyper.evaluator.storage.Storage` interface to record and retrieve jobs metadata. A panel of different storage is provided: local memory, Redis, and Ray.

Finally, the user can choose a **search strategy** to suggest new configurations to evaluate. These strategies are defined in the :mod:`deephyper.search` module and vary depending if the problem is for hyperparameter optimization (:mod:`deephyper.search.hps`) or neural architecture search (:mod:`deephyper.search.nas`).

Parallel Execution
==================

By leveraging these different software components, DeepHyper can support different parallel execution schemes. The following figures (2 - 7) illustrate some of these schemes. First, a **sequential execution** (Figure 2) can be done through the :class:`deephyper.evaluator.SerialEvaluator` which is a simple wrapper around the ``run``-function (denoted as the :math:`\text{objective } f\text{-unction}` in the figures).

    **Figure 2**: Execution of a search with a :class:`deephyper.evaluator.SerialEvaluator` on 1 node. If the search is a Bayesian optimization strategy then this setting represents a sequential Bayesian optimization procedure.

Then, a **centralized execution** can be done through other evaluators such as :class:`deephyper.evaluator.ProcessPoolEvaluator` (Figure 3) and :class:`deephyper.evaluator.MPICommEvaluator` (Figure 4). In these cases, only 1 optimizer is present (the manager represented by :math:`\mathcal{S}`) with 4 workers per node (represented by :math:`f`). The manager is responsible for suggesting new configurations to evaluate and the workers are responsible for evaluating them. The manager and the workers can be on the same node (Figure 3) or on different nodes (Figure 4). The manager and the workers can be distributed on different nodes through MPI (Figure 4) but also through other backends such as Ray with a :class:`deephyper.evaluator.RayEvaluator`. The manager and the workers can be synchronous or asynchronous (by batch). The manager and the workers can both use different storage types (e.g., local memory, Redis, or Ray). The :mod:`deephyper.evaluator.storage` provides more details on storage types.

The **centralized execution** has the disadvantage to have an overhead depending on the number of workers of the manager (optimizer). This can be problematic and lead to a bottleneck (e.g., with the constant liar scheme for Bayesian optimization) while often remaining more efficient with respect to optimization iterations (i.e., better improvement of the objective per iteration). The **distributed execution** is a way to mitigate this overhead dependency on the number of workers. In a **pure** distributed execution, 1 optimizer is attributed to each worker and each of these optimizers only has to suggest a new configuration to its corresponding worker. Therefore, the overhead of the optimizer when suggesting new configurations does not depend on the number of workers (good for scaling to more workers!). The distributed execution is illustrated in Figures 5 (1 node) and 6 (2 nodes). The :class:`deephyper.search.hps.MPIDistributedBO` is a wrapper around the Bayesian optimization strategy to do distributed execution through MPI.

Finally, it is also possible to mix the **centralized** and **distributed** execution to manage the trade-off between iteration efficiency and scaling of the number of workers as presented in Figure 7.

    **Figure 7**: Execution of a search with a mix of centralized and distributed executions. Two centralized executions each with 4 workers are distributed on 2 nodes. This scheme is using the :class:`deephyper.search.hps.MPIDistributedBO` and the :class:`deephyper.evaluator.ProcessPoolEvaluator`.
