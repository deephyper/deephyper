"""The ``stopper`` module provides features to observe intermediate performances of iterative algorithm and decide dynamically if its evaluation should be stopped or continued.

This module was inspired from the Pruner interface and implementation of `Optuna <https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/pruners.html>`_.

The ``Stopper`` class is the base class for all stoppers. It provides the interface for the ``observe`` and ``stop`` methods that should be implemented by all stoppers. The ``observe`` method is called at each iteration of the iterative algorithm and the ``stop`` method is called at the end of each iteration to decide if the evaluation should be stopped or continued. The stopper object is not used directly but through the ``RunningJob`` received by the ``run``-function. In the following example we demonstrate with a simulation how it can be used:

.. code-block:: python

    import time

    from deephyper.problem import HpProblem
    from deephyper.search.hps import CBO
    from deephyper.stopper import SuccessiveHalvingStopper


    def run(job):

        x = job.parameters["x"]

        # Simulation of iteration
        cum = 0
        for i in range(100):
            cum += x
            time.sleep(0.01) # each iteration cost 0.1 secondes

            # Record the intermediate performance
            # Calling stopper.observe(budget, objective) under the hood
            job.record(budget=i + 1, objective=cum)

            # Check if the evaluation should be stopped
            # Calling stopper.stop() under the hood
            if job.stopped():
                break

        # Return objective and metadata to save what is the maximum step reached
        return {"objective": cum, "metadata": {"i_stopped": i}}


    problem = HpProblem()
    problem.add_hyperparameter((0.0, 100.0), "x")

    stopper = SuccessiveHalvingStopper(min_steps=1, max_steps=100)
    search =  CBO(problem, run, stopper=stopper, log_dir="multi-fidelity-exp")
    results = search.search(timeout=10)


As it can be observed in the following results many evaluation stopped after the first iteration which saved
a lot of computation time. If evaluated fully, each configuration would take about 1 seconds and we would be able
to compute only a maximum of 10 configurations (because we set a timeout of 10). However, with the stopper we managed
to perform 15 evaluations instead.
